# Guess_Number_Assembly_Project
Guess Number is a project created by assembly language.
The idea of ​​the project is to allow the user to guess a number of 3 digits from 0 to 255.
The program helps the user after every time he enters a number.
If the entered value is not greater than the value that the user must guess, the program will tell him that the value is more, and so on.
